# 3D-Hand-Gesture-with-particle-system-
A real-time 3D Hand Gesture Interaction System enhanced with a dynamic particle system. This project uses hand-tracking to capture natural gestures and maps them to immersive 3D particle behaviors—creating fluid, responsive, and visually rich interactions.  Real-time 3D hand tracking  Gesture-driven particle effects (attract, repel, swirl, morph
