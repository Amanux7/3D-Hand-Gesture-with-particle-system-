A real-time 3D Hand Gesture Interaction System enhanced with a dynamic particle system.
This project uses hand-tracking to capture natural gestures and maps them to immersive 3D particle behaviors—creating fluid, responsive, and visually rich interactions.

Key highlights:

Real-time 3D hand tracking

Gesture-driven particle effects (attract, repel, swirl, morph)

Smooth performance with optimized rendering

Modular architecture for easy extension

Ideal for interactive art, creative coding, WebXR, and experimental UI/UX

Built as an exploration of human–computer interaction, spatial UX, and next-gen input systems, where motion becomes the interface and particles become the feedback.
